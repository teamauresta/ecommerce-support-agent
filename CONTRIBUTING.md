# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Here's how to get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Install dependencies (see README for setup instructions)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One PR per feature or fix — keep them focused
- Write a clear title following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Describe what changed and why in the PR body
- Link any related issues with `Closes #<issue>`

## Code Style

- Python: formatted with `ruff` — run `ruff format .` before committing
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials — use environment variables
- Keep `.env.example` updated if you add new env vars
